# Perk the Star

Perk the Star is a Godot 4.6 orbital tower defense game about defending the Sun with satellites that rotate on concentric rings. Campaign mode is a 12-wave Prime mission; Endless mode keeps scaling enemy mix, HP, speed, and pressure; Tech XP turns finished runs into permanent tower-path unlocks.

The project now keeps most reusable systems in C++ GDExtension and leaves `scripts/game/game.gd` as the main Godot gameplay coordinator. That makes the code easier to explain: C++ handles reusable data, math, HUD, audio, and helper systems; GDScript connects the scene, input, drawing, and wave flow.

## Run

1. Open this repository root in Godot, not the nested `game/` folder.
2. Run `project.godot`.
3. Click Start Defense, then pick Campaign, Boss Rush, Daily Seed, Draft Defense, Endless, or No-Flare Challenge.

The game targets a 1920x1080 canvas with expand stretching enabled.

## Modes

- Campaign is the fixed 12-wave mission with the Prime boss finale.
- Boss Rush is a four-wave compressed Prime Echo mode with extra starting Sol and boss music from launch.
- Daily Seed is a six-wave date-based challenge with the same enemy mix for everyone on that day.
- Draft Defense is a six-wave contract run: pick one of three random perks before Wave 1, then clear five remixed waves and a Prime-style finale.
- Endless generates scaling waves forever: enemy mix, count, HP, speed, and breach damage rise over time, with clash, formation, and Prime Echo waves mixed in.
- No-Flare Challenge reuses the Prime campaign but disables Solar Flare and pays bonus Tech XP.
- Tech XP is earned at run end and spent on permanent tech tree unlocks that affect tower stats, rewards, flare cadence, and Helios Slingshot.
- The Tech Tree top-right Effects toggle can disable or re-enable unlocked upgrade effects without removing unlocks.
- Perfect Orbit bonuses pay extra Sol and score when a wave is cleared without losing luminosity.
- Fast kill combos add bonus score, and slowed Solar Farmers pay bonus Sol when defeated.
- Best campaign, no-flare, and endless records are saved in `user://settings.cfg`.

Good next additions: per-mode best records for Boss Rush, Daily Seed, and Draft Defense.

## Native Extension

The GDExtension source lives in `gdextension/src`. Godot loads it from `game/bin/perk_the_star.gdextension`, which points to `game/bin/perk_the_star.dll`.

To rebuild on Windows:

```powershell
scons platform=windows target=template_debug arch=x86_64
```

`godot-cpp`, `.godot/`, build intermediates, generated DLLs, exported game bundles, generated media/PDFs, and SCons cache files are ignored because they can be regenerated.

## Main Native Classes

- `GameCatalogNative` stores balance constants, enemy definitions, tower definitions, ring data, and active asset paths.
- `GameRuntimeNative` stores small runtime helpers such as easing, screen shake, BGM selection, and projectile hit tests.
- `GameOrbitMathNative` handles ring radius, slot angle, tower position, and nearest-slot math.
- `GameTowerLibraryNative` calculates tower stats, costs, refunds, and HUD button data.
- `GameWaveLibraryNative` loads wave JSON and formats Wave Intel text.
- `GameHudNative` owns the gameplay HUD controls, cards, signals, and layout.
- `GameSfxBusNative` loads SFX files and provides generated fallback sounds.
- `GameEffectStoreNative` stores temporary shots, floating text, and visual effects.
- `GameStateNative` stores global match state and saved settings.
- `MusicManagerNative` owns menu music playback.

## Repo Cleanup

Backup-only media, archived roadmap notes, generated PDFs, exported builds, and built DLLs are not kept in git. If a generated file is needed again, rebuild it from source instead of committing it.
